Islander Shell :
					Utilization of fork and exec is the main aim of this project. 'hist' is the shell inbuilt command and it is implemented by using linked list provided by the STL library. For I/O redirection 'dup2' a system call to duplicate the file discriptors is used. Finally Islander shell is simple replecation of original shell with two inbuilt commands [hist, r n]
